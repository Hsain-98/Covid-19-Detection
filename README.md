# Covid-19-Detection
The Covid-19 first occurred in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. After that, the virus
spread all around the world. The usage of sophisticated artificial intelligence technology (AI)
and the radiological images of COVID-19 cases can provide experts with auxiliary diagnosis
suggestions, reducing the burden of experts to a certain amount and speeding up the
diagnostic process. In this study, transfer learning methods have been implemented, with six
pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks models: VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3,
InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, and EfficientNetB0 on a dataset of chest X-ray images of
patients with COVID-19 disease, viral pneumonia, and normal cases. Transfer learning is an
ambitious task, and it results in impressive outcomes for identifying distinct patterns in tiny
datasets of medical images. The experimental results show that MobileNet pre-trained model
achieved a relatively ideal effect, and the diagnostic accuracy reached 96.05% outperforming
all other models.
